# AutoClaims
AutoClaims is a Liberty Mutual intern hackathon project to attempt to automate the car insurance claims process by allowing individuals to submit images of their damaged cars so the application can automatically evaluate whether there is or isn't car damage.

# Machine Learning Algorithm 

[Adapted from this tutorial:](https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2018/07/building-mask-r-cnn-model-detecting-damage-cars-python/)

1. Collected Dataset from random google images by searching keywords such as "damaged cars", etc. 
2. Used Annotation Tool to mark the damaged region for the training data and stored that information in via_region_data.json 
3. Cloned the [matterport/Mask_R_CNN repo:](https://github.com/matterport/Mask_RCNN)
4. Built the inspect_custom_model.pynb with the help of the tutorial to evaluate whether a car is damaged or not. 

# Application 

Not able to release the code because it is Liberty Mutual's Property

Used React, Flask and Mongo DB to build the application.
